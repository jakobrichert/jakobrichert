# Jakob Richert

Systems engineer based in Copenhagen. I like building things that sit close to the hardware — embedded systems, IoT platforms, data pipelines, scientific computing.

Currently at **DLF Seeds**, leading R&D system consolidation across 79 crop species — migrating decades of legacy breeding data into a unified platform, and building React/Next.js middleware to integrate laboratory and field equipment.

Previously helped rebuild the IoT platform at **Arctic Spas** — embedded Linux firmware (Yocto), MQTT infrastructure, and manufacturing automation for 50,000+ connected devices.

## What I'm working on

- **[openblup](https://github.com/jakobrichert/openblup)** — Open-source REML and BLUP engine in Rust for plant and animal breeding. Modern mixed-model solver for quantitative genetics.
- **[OpenVoice V2 on Tenstorrent](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/pull/36286)** — Porting the OpenVoice V2 voice cloning model to Tenstorrent's TTNN framework. Also contributed a [device hang fix](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/pull/24330) to tt-metal.
- **[space-colonization](https://github.com/jakobrichert/space-colonization)** — Interactive 3D procedural tree generation using the space colonization algorithm. C + raylib.
- **[planter-gate-3d](https://github.com/jakobrichert/planter-gate-3d)** — Interactive 3D step-by-step build guide for a toddler-safe planter gate. Three.js.

## Background

Full-stack across the whole stack — firmware (C, Structured Text), backend (Python/Django, Node), frontend (React/Next.js), infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Docker), and data (PostgreSQL, dbt). Past work includes Web3 smart contracts (Algorand/PyTeal), quantum computing explorations (Qiskit), and e-commerce platforms.

CS from the University of Alberta. Originally from Canada, now in Denmark.
